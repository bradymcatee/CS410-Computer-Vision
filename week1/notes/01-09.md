## Colors

RGB color space is NOT unique -- it varies by device

XYZ is a color space that can represent ANY color

### Accurate Color Reproduction:

- Need to do color calibration

- Fix the lighting conditions of the environment and brightness/contrast of monitor

- Determine the monitors gamma

- Use standard color cards to match colors on the screen to the cards

Any color space that can be represented with a matrix is a linear color space

HSV color space -- hue, saturation, value -- more intuitive for humans when designing things

RGB is NOT perecptually uniform -- distance between two points does not neccessarily represent their distance in visual color

MacAdam Ellipses shows regions in which all colors in that region indistinguishable

LAB is a color space that is close to perceptually uniform -- its not perfect though

## FILTERS

### Image Filtering:

- Computes function of local neighborhood at each pixel location
- Useful for enhancing, extracting information from, and detecting patterns in images
- Represented with kernels/matrices
- Center the matrix on the input image and compute the new pixel value by multiplying and adding up the old pixel values with the filter matrix

### Box Filter

- Replaces each pixel with an average of its neighborhood
- Achieves smoothing effect -- removes sharp features
- Can have blocky results and axis-aligned streaks

### Gaussian Filter

- Isotropic (rotationally symmetric)
- Weight contributions of neighboring pixels by nearness
- Achieves a smoothing effect without blocky artifacts -- better result than box filter
- Standard deviation is a parameter that determines the extent of smoothing
- The greater the standard deviation, the more blurry the result
- Gaussian function is separable -- we can apply 1D horizontal and vertical filters separately to reduce computational complexity from k^2 to k
- Filter size is another paramater -- larger filter sizes approximate the gaussian function better but significantly increases compute time
- In practice, use filter size of 2k+1 x 2k+1 where k~3\sigma (sigma is standard deviation)

### Practical Matters

- Near the edges, the filter window falls of the edge of image
- Many methods for handling edges: clipping, wrap around, copy edge, reflect across edge

### Properties of Smoothing Filters

- Values are all positive, sum to 1, removes high-frequency components, "low-pass" filter

### Key Properties of Linear Filters

- filter(f1+f2) = filter(f1) + filter(f2) -- linearity
- filter(shift(f)) = shift(filter(f)) -- shift invariance

### Median Filter

- Replace pixel by the median value of its neighbors
- No filter kernel -- no new pixel values introduced
- Removes spikes: good for impulse, salt & pepper noise
- Nonlinear filter
- Only paramater is window size -- how many neighbors do you want to include in the median calculation?
- VERY slow algorithm
