## Edge Detection

**Goal:** Identify sudden changes in an image

- Most semantic and shape information from the image can be encoded in the edges

- More compact than pixels

### Origin of Edges

Edges can be caused by different things:

- Surface normal discontinuity

- Depth discontinuity

- Surface color discontinuity

- Illumination discontinuity

### Characterizing Edges

An edge is a place of rapid change in the image intensity function

Edges can be detected by finding the first derivative of the input signal

#### Derivatives with convolution

For discrete data, we can approximate the partial derivative using finite differences between two pixels

## Image Gradient

The gradient of an image is a 2-D vector with one component being the partial derivative with respect to x and the other component being the parital derivative with respect to y

The gradient points in the direction of most rapid increase in intensity

The _edge strength_ is given by the magnitude of the gradient

## Effects of Noise

If an image is noisy, run the image through a gaussian filter to smooth it, then calculate the gradients

### Derivative Theorem of Convolution

Differentiation is convolution, and convolution is associative

We apply the derivative to the gaussian function, then we apply the result to the input image

## Smoothing vs Derivative Filters

### Smoothing Filters

- Guassian: remove high frequency components -- low-pass filter

### Derivative Filters

- Derivatives of the guassian

## The Canny Edge Detector

1. Filter image with derivative of Guassian

2. Find the magnitude and orientation of gradient

3. Non-maximum suppression

   - Thin wide "ridges" down to single pixel width

4. Linking and thresholding (hysteresis)
   - Define two thresholds: low and high
   - Use the high threshold to start edge curves and the low threshold to continue them
